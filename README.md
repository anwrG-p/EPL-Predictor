# EPL-Predictor
# Overview

This is a personal project exploring how well AI can predict English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes. Using historical match data from 1993 to 2024, this project aims to:
Test the boundaries of AI prediction in sports.

Learn and research machine learning workflows, including feature engineering, neural networks, and model calibration.
The model predicts whether the home team will win, the match will draw, or the away team will win.

# Features

Time-aware train/validation/test splits
Embeddings for categorical features and MLP for numeric inputs
Temperature scaling for calibrated probability predictions
Evaluation with log loss, accuracy, and Brier score
Simple betting backtest against implied bookmaker probabilities

# Technologies

Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
tqdm for progress bars

# Learning Goals

Structuring a full ML workflow for tabular data
Neural network experimentation for prediction tasks
Model calibration techniques
Applying ML to real-world sports data
